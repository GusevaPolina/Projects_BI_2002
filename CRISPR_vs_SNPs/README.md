What is done: 
  - SNPs from genotyping chips by 23andMe for our professor are cleaned from deletions and insertions using plink;
  - annotated by the snpEff data is compared to the ClinVar and GWAS databases;
  - haplogroups are hypothesised using MThap and MorleyDna (tools by the International Society of Genetic Genealogy);
  - eye and skin colour are suggested based on Hart _et al._ 2013 (doi: [10.3325/cmj.2013.54.248](https://doi.org/10.3325%2Fcmj.2013.54.248));
  - mutations are identified by Variant Effect Predictor (VEP);
  - suggestions are made for futuristic correction by CRISPR-Cas9 of 
    * 5 SNPs to prevent potential disorders,
    * 5 SNPs to improve quality of life.
