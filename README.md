# Projects_BI_2002
This repository stores my small bioinformatics researchs.

<br />

Currently it contains the following projects:
  - **Which genes provide resistance to ampicillin in _Escherichia coli_?** (reads filtering, alignment to a reference genome by the
Burrows-Wheeler transform, SNPs annotation and analysis) `Tools`: FastQC, Trimmomatic, BWA, samtools, VarScan, snpEff
  - **Breakthrough flu flew through my door** (deep sequencing analysis with controls, alignment to a reference gene by the
Burrows-Wheeler transform, SNPs analysis, protein visualisation) `Tools`: FastQC, BWA, samtools, bedtools, VarScan, SWISS-MODEL and PDB MolStar Viewer, Python
  - **Sprouting diarrhoea with bloody consequences** (_de novo_ genome assembly, k-mers analysis, genome annotation, search for the closest relative by nucleoitide and protein sequences, search of virulent factors) `Tools`: FastQC, jellyfish, SPAdes, QUAST, Prokka, Barrnap, Mauve, RefFinder, BLAST, Python
  - and more coming
