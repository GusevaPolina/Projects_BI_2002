# Which genes provide resistance to ampicillin in _Escherichia coli_?
by Polina Guseva and Nikita Vyatkin

<br />

What is done: 
  - shotgun reads from a resistant strain are filtered by quality and aligned to the reference;
  - established mutations with acceptable coverage are coupled to the _E. coli_ genes; 
  - an alternative antibiotic is suggested.

> Please, a lab notebook with the whole pipeline and a report attached.
