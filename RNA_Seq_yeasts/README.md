# Easy peasy baking switchy
by Polina Guseva, Anastasiia Dudkovskaia

<br />

What is done: 
  - RNA-Seq reads before and after the switch from respiration to fermentation are annotated to the genome of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_;
  - the number of reads aligned to each gene are counted by `featureCounts`;
  - based on that differential gene expression is calculated by `Deseq2`;
  - pathways of top50 most changed genes are shown by `Gene Ontology Slim Term Mapper`;
  - the carbohydrate metabolism is visualised by `pathview`.
