# Tardigrades: piglets that bear a unique DNA protection
by Polina Guseva and Nikita Vyatkin

<br />

What is done: 
  - the assembled genome of _Ramazzottius_ _varieornatus_ is functionally annotated by AUGUSTUS;
  - proteins from a chromatin fracture by tandem mass spectrometry are overlapped with those annotated genes by BLAST+;
  - additional sorting to filter only nuclear ones by:
    * predicting localisation (WoLF PSORT, TargetP);
    * predicting functions (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, Pfam/HMMER).
