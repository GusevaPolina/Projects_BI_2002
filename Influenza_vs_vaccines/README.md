# Breakthrough flu flew through my door
by Zhandos Ayupov, Polina Guseva

<br />

What is done: 
  - deep-sequenced hemagglutinin reads of a breakthrough influenza strain are aligned to the HA gene;
  - three controls are used to filter sequencing and PCR noise; 
  - only missense mutation found as the amino acid substitution in the epitope causing less vaccine efficiency;
  - by its low frequency this SNP is classified as a mix of viral quasi-species leading to antigenic shift.
