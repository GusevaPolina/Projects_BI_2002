# Sprouting diarrhoea with bloody consequences
by Polina Bogaichuk, Sergei Fomenko, and Polina Guseva

<br />

What is done: 
  - HiSeq reads from a HUS-causing _E. coli_ strain are _de novo_ assembled into a genome;
  - pair-ended and mate-pair reads are used together to resolve short repeats;
  - the assembly is annotated and statistically analysed; 
  - k-mers are used to approximate a genome size;
  - the closest relative for the reference is found by 16S rRNA;
  - multiple drug resistance is obtained by horizontal gene transfer and _Shiga_ toxins by prophage incorporation.

> Please, a lab notebook with the whole pipeline and a report attached.
